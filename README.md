# Clean Magento Sample Data for 1.9
Removed duplicate files, JPGmini-fied all files, Removed unused files

It's based on the default magento sample data packages available through (http://www.magentocommerce.com/downloads/assets/1.9.1.0/magento-sample-data-1.9.1.0.tar.gz)[http://www.magentocommerce.com/downloads/assets/1.9.1.0/magento-sample-data-1.9.1.0.tar.gz]

## What I did
* Used Photosweeper to identify and remove duplicate images + some handcrafted file renaming
* Used JPEGmini to almost lossless compress all jpg files
* Removed files that are not referenced in sql-dump
