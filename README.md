It's based on the default magento sample data packages available through [http://www.magentocommerce.com/downloads/assets/1.9.1.0/magento-sample-data-1.9.1.0.tar.gz](http://www.magentocommerce.com/downloads/assets/1.9.1.0/magento-sample-data-1.9.1.0.tar.gz)

## What I did
* Used Photosweeper to identify and remove duplicate images + some handcrafted file renaming
* Used JPEGmini to almost lossless compress all jpg files
* Removed files that are not referenced in sql-dump

# Even more space saved

There's a second branch _compressed_ that contains the much harder compressed versions of all these images. So the package might be even smaller while the graphics might look a bit lossy.
